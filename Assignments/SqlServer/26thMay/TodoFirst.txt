Create table Student 
rollno int 
name 
address
hindimarks
engmarks
mathsmarks


insert some records
update records where hindimarks are less than 10 to 90

Do you see some problems in this table? How can we resolve it?

Yes , use contstraints. We cannnot allow any value to be entered in the columns
So , add constraints

Rollno should be primary key, and there coulb be only 20 students

name, address , all marks columns should not allow nulls

marks columns should have values from 0 to 100

insert some records 

Add one more column Stream (IT, ECE , CSE)

What values do you get in previous records
